modular agentic automation system that takes a small product dataset and automatically generates structured content

multi-agent workflow is a priority so I decided to use 4 agents namely - a control agent, parsing agent, content agent, page format agent for the right output. 

for the data itself, resusable content logic makes sure that the oyutput is not hardcoded a standard template function would be made
